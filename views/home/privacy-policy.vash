Privacy Policy
</h3>

<p>
This privacy policy (this "<span class="under bold">Policy</span>") describes the collection of personal information by Store Space and all affiliates ("<span class="under bold">Company</span>," "<span class="under bold">we</span>," or "<span class="under bold">us</span>") from users of our Web site at www.storespace.com (the "<span class="under bold">Website</span>"), as well as all related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Website, our "<span class="under bold">Services</span>").  This Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information.  By using our Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Policy.  This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Company Terms of Use (available at <a href="/terms">https://www.storespace.com/terms</a>) and subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use.
</p>

<h4>
Personal Information
</h4>

<p>
"<span class="under bold">Personal Information</span>," as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.  Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Services, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.
</p>

<p>
Personal Information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information.  Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.  We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.
</p>

<h4>
Collection of Information

Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information

<ul>
We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Services.  These include the following:
<li>

</li>
<li>
<span class="under">User Accounts and Profiles</span>:  Our Services may give you the ability to register for a Company account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service.  If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Services, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile.  This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you.  We may indicate that some personal information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.
</li>
<li>
<span class="under">Interactive Features</span>:  Our Services may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Services, post comments to forums, to upload user information and other content (the "<span class="under bold">User Materials</span>") to your account, participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Services and with other users.  If you use any interactive functionality on our Services that request or permit you to provide us with personal information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Services), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.
</li>

<li>
<span class="under">Contests and Sweepstakes</span>:  We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Services.  Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners.  In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us.  The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.
</li>
</ul>

Passive Information Collection

<p>
When you visit our Services, some information is collected automatically.  For example, when you access our Services, we automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Services, the actions you take on our Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Services.  We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
</p>

<p>
We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons").  We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Services, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.  If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy.  Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.
</p>

<p>
Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Services or sites or services provided by third parties ("<span class="under bold">Third-Party Sites</span>") that may be linked to from the Services, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services, Third-Party Sites or content.  We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.

To Protect our Interests

<p>
We also disclose Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other users of the Services.
</p>

<h4>

<p>
If you receive promotional e-mail from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the e-mail.  You may also opt-out from receiving promotional e-mail from us, and any other promotional communications that we may send to you from time to time (e.g., by postal mail) by sending your request to us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@storespace.com">privacy@storespace.com</a> or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.

<p>
If we offer the ability to create user accounts or profiles on our Services, you may have the ability to access and update many categories of personal information that you provide to us by logging in to your account and accessing your account settings.  If you wish to access or amend any other personal information we hold about you, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@storespace.com">privacy@storespace.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you request that we delete your account on any of our Services (via a user settings page, by e-mail, or otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your Personal Information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
</p>

<h4>
Links
</h4>

<p>
The Services may contain links to other Web sites, products, or services that we do not own or operate.  For example, the Services may contain links to third-party merchants from which users may purchase sound recordings that are streamed through the Services.  The Services also may contain links to Third-Party Sites such as social networking services.  If you choose to visit or use any Third-Party Sites or products or services available on or through such Third-Party Sites, please be aware that this Policy will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using those Third-Party Sites or any products or services available on or through such Third-Party Sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third-Party Sites or any products or services on or through them.  Additionally, please be aware that the Services may contain links to Web sites and services that we operate but that are governed by different privacy policies.  We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to any Web site or service you visit other than the Services before providing any Personal Information on them.
</p>

<h4>
International Visitors
</h4>

<p>
Our servers and data centers are located in the United States.  If you choose to use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S.  Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services.  You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.
</p>

<h4>
Security
</h4>

<p>
We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect personal information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction.  Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective.  Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us.  You transmit information to us at your own risk.
</p>

<h4>
Updates to this Policy
</h4>

<p>
We may occasionally update this Policy.  When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the Policy.  Your continued use of our Services after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy.  If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.
